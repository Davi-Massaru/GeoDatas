## Project description

This project contains an example of how we get to manipulate geographic data on an IRIS Intersystem platform.


It holds a simple scheme about restaurants and deliverypeople, checking the distance between them.


The platform also has a REACT made interface to view data and a REST layer, allowing to handle endpoints.

## Prerequisites

Verify if you have Docker, Node JS and Yarn downloaded and installed.

## Installation 

Clone/git pull the repository into any local directory

```
$ git clone 
```

Open the terminal in this directory and run for build the backend:

```
$ docker-compose build --no-cache
```

Run the IRIS container with your project:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```
